    <div class="section1">
        <h>Reasons why we should save the envoirment </h>
        <p> we all know that we love our plant but we dont take care of it if you just dont care me a 10 year old girl
            will show you(I AM ACTALLY 10) </p>
        <p>I hope you understand the purpose of this website </p>
        <h>Reason one we live on this plant </h>
        <p>we all known forever we live on the 1 and only EARTH but we never take care much think about this</p>
        <p>an example is... </p>
        <p>imagine you have a house you clean and take care of it and live in it but you dont do it  at outside nauture
            places earth is just like a house BUT you dont care for it you HAVE to care becasue the impact on earth is a bad thing but you think it isnt but
            IMPACT FOR YOU so take care of earth becasue. WE LIVE ON EARTH!
         </p><BR>

        <h> Second reasson we can have a beautiful envoirment</h>
        <p> in some places they are beautiful usally becasue it is taken care of if you look below there is a beautiful
            image of a mostly nauture that is rare but it could have been common if we took care of earth and grew plants ALL THE TIME! so take care of earth and you can get something beautiful in a image and reality and still see it at home(if you look at the second image)
